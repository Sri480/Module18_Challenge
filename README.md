# Module18_Challenge

## Neural Networks and Depp Learning

### Project: Module 18 submission

### Description:
Develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model to accurately detect spam emails. Create two classification models (Logistic regression model and Random Forest model), to fit the provided data, and evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam.
I work at a company that specializes in student loan refinancing. I have been asked to create a model to predict student loan repayment.

### Libraries
- pandas
- tensorflow, tensorflow.keras.layers, tensorflow.keras.models
- sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.metrics

### Input dataset:
CSV file that contains information about previous student loan recipients

### Goal:
Use the features in the provided dataset to create a model that will predict the likelihood that an applicant will repay their student loans

### Jupyter Notebook:
student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb

### Saved Model:
student_loans.keras

### Output:
- Prepare the data to be used on a neural netwo
- Compile and Evaluate a Model Using a Neural Network
- Predict Loan Repayment Success by Using your Neural Network Model
- Discuss creating a recommendation system for student loans
